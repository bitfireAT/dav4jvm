/**
 * Compares two [HttpUrl]s in WebDAV context. If two URLs are considered *equal*, both
 * represent the same WebDAV resource.
 *
 * The fragment of an URL is ignored, e.g. `http://host:80/folder1` and `http://HOST/folder1#somefragment`
 * are considered to be equal.
 *
 * [HttpUrl] is less strict than [java.net.URI] and allows for instance (not encoded) square brackets in the path.
 * So this method tries to normalize the URI by converting it to a [java.net.URI] (encodes for instance square brackets)
 * and then comparing the scheme and scheme-specific part (without fragment).
 *
 * Attention: **This method does not deal with trailing slashes**, so if you want to compare collection URLs,
 * make sure they both (don't) have a trailing slash before calling this method, for instance
 * with [omitTrailingSlash] or [withTrailingSlash].
 *
 * @param other the URL to compare the current object with
 *
 * @return whether the URLs are considered to represent the same WebDAV resource
