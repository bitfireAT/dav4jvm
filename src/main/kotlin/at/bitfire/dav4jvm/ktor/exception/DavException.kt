/**
 * Signals that an error occurred during a WebDAV-related operation.
 *
 * This could be a logical error like when a required ETag has not been received, but also an explicit HTTP error
 * (usually with a subclass of [HttpException], which in turn extends this class).
 *
 * Often, HTTP response bodies contain valuable information about the error in text format (for instance, a HTML page
 * that contains details about the error) and/or as `<DAV:error>` XML elements. However, such response bodies
 * are sometimes very large.
 *
 * So, if possible and useful, a size-limited excerpt of the associated HTTP request and response can be
 * attached and subsequently included in application-level debug info or shown to the user.
 *
 * Note: [Exception] is serializable, so objects of this class must contain only serializable objects.
 *
 * @param statusCode        status code of associated HTTP response
 * @param requestExcerpt    cached excerpt of associated HTTP request body
 * @param responseExcerpt   cached excerpt of associated HTTP response body
 * @param errors            precondition/postcondition XML elements which have been found in the XML response
